            <h2>Seattle, Washington</h2>
            <p>Seattle, Washington, known as the Emerald City, is Washington's most famous city, and one of the most
               iconic cities in the country. Numerous shows, movies, and songs have ties to the city, and for good
               reason. With a skyline that's immediately recognizable with its Space Needle and world-famous experiences
               like the Pike Place Market, there's something for everyone in Seattle.</p>
            <p>Seattle is a city that's always been a little different. It was one of the primary centers of jazz in the
               first half of the 20th century, originating the careers of icons like Ray Charles, Quincy Jones, and many
               more. Also known as the birthplace of the grunge rock music, Seattle is home to bands such as Nirvana,
               Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, and more. The location of movies and shows like Frazier and Sleepless in
               Seattle, the city's culture is alive and well with music, visual arts, and theater.</p>
            <p>The city is also known for being a center for high quality coffee. The hometown of Starbucks Coffee, you
               can find a delicious cup somewhere on nearly every block. With the weather being nice and cool nearly
               year-round, a nice cup of joe on your porch or at a cafe each morning is a great way to take in the Pacific
               Northwest air. With the Puget Sound and Pacific Ocean to the east, Mount Rainier and the Olympic Mountain
               Range nearby, and countless forests and other natural sights to see, Seattle is the place to be.</p>
