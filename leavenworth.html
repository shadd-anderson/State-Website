            <h2>Leavenworth, Washington</h2>
            <p>Tucked away deep in the Cascade Mountains, you'll find a unique town full of personality: Leavenworth,
               Washington. This quaint little town is built up like a Bavarian village and will have you wondering if
               you'd entered a portal to 18th-century Germany. Of course, the cars and modern infrastructure will set
               you right, but it's still fun to pretend.</p>
            <p>Come for the brats and pretzels, stay for the eclectic Christmas light displays and reindeer farm. You'll
               always find something fun to do when you visit this beautiful town. With over 30 restaurants featuring
               foods from around the world, including taverns, a cider house, and plenty of bakeries, you're sure to find
               something to whet your appetite. After you've finished eating, head out to the reindeer farm on the edge
               of town. Come during the spring to see the newborn babies, during the fall to see them shed their antlers
               (not for the faint of heart!), or bring the kids during the Christmas season to visit Santa and his famous
               sled-leading crew.</p>
            <p>Speaking of Christmas, Leavenworth is known around the country for its incredible holiday lights displays.
               The whole city is set aglow with the spirit of the holidays and is sure to fill your spirit with glee. No
               Grinch or Scrooge in sight!</p>
