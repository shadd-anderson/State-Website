            <h3>Fun fact:</h3>
            <p>Olympia became the capital of Washington State when the territory became a state in 1889. At the time it
               only had one railway into the city, but it was chosen due to its location on the Puget Sound and
               accessibility to nearby farmers.</p>
            <h3>Fun fact 2:</h3>
            <p>Olympia is named after the Olympic Mountain range that can be seen from the city.</p>

            <h2>Olympia, Washington</h2>
            <p>Olympia, Washington - the capital of the state of Washington, resides on the south end of the Puget Sound.
               A great central location for the surrounding area, Olympia provides more than just government buildings
               and the like. The city is home to a number of parks and nature areas, easy access to forests, mountains,
               and waterfront activities, and hosts a plethora of artistic and cultural experiences.</p>
            <p>Olympia was originally home to a number of Lushootseed-speaking peoples, including the Squaxin, Nisqually,
               Puyallup, Chehalis, Suquamish, and Duwamish. The city was then claimed by Edmund Sylvester and Levi Lathrop
               Smith in 1846 before housing the customs house of Washington territory in 1851. It was then chosen as the
               capital after the territory became a state in 1889.</p>
            <p>Today, Olympia is a regional center of fine arts, including theatre, music, and visual art. The city has
               a number of art venues, museums, and music venues and is home to the area's largest Earth Day celebration
               - The Procession of the Species. It also is home to over 40 parks and nature conservation areas. The city
               also has a large waterfront area that allows for easy access to the Puget Sound for a day on the water!
