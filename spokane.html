            <h2>Spokane, Washington</h2>
            <p>Named after the Spokane tribe of Native Americans that lived in the area, Spokane is a city in Eastern
               Washington that has really put their name on the map. Once the location of the very first long-term
               European settlement in Washington, the storied city has seen everything from pioneers, gold hunters,
               and even the World's Fair. Spokane is a hub for culture, recreation, nature, and much more!</p>
            <p>The area was first occupied by hunter-gatherers some 8,000 to 13,000 years ago. The Spokane people then
               lived nearby and were met by fur trappers in the early 19th century. After being established as a trading
               post for the North West Company, the city was officially incorporated as Spokane Falls in 1881. The town
               exploded after the discovery of gold, silver, and lead in the area, and continued thriving off lumber and
               farming industries. As the railroad made its way around the country, Spokane quickly became an important
               center in the western U.S.</p>
            <p>Today Spokane is a cultural and economic central point of Eastern Washington. It hosted the World's Fair
               in 1974 - the first world's fair to be environmentally-themed - and is home to one of the biggest
               waterfalls in the area (Spokane Falls). With many sports teams, lots of recreational activities, and
               natural sights to see, there's much to see and do in Spokane!</p>
